        "The assumption is that the output activations of a properly trained teacher network carry additional information that can be leveraged by a student network during training.\n",
        "The original work suggests that utilizing ratios of smaller probabilities in the soft targets can help achieve the underlying objective of deep neural networks,\n",
        "which is to create a similarity structure over the data where similar objects are mapped closer together.\n",

        "if its wheels are present, but it is less likely to be mistaken for a dog.\n",
        "Therefore, it makes sense to assume that valuable information resides not only in the top prediction of a properly trained model but in the entire output distribution.\n",
        "However, cross entropy alone does not sufficiently exploit this information as the activations for non-predicted classes\n",
